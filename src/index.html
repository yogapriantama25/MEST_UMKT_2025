            <h3>Terms of Submission</h3>
            <p>
                Papers must be submitted on the understanding that they have not been published elsewhere (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture, review, or thesis) and are not currently under consideration by another journal published by any publisher. The submitting author is responsible for ensuring that the article's publication has been approved by all the other co-authors. It is also the author's responsibility to ensure that the articles emanating from a particular institution are submitted with the approval of the necessary institution. Only an acknowledgment from the editorial office officially establishes the date of receipt. Further correspondence and proof will be sent to the author(s) before publication unless otherwise indicated. It is the condition of submission of a paper that the authors permit editing of the paper for readability.
            </p>

            <h2>Review Policy</h2>
            <h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
            <p>
                The submitted papers will be evaluated (initial review) by the track director to check the suitability of the papers with the conference's focus and scopes. Afterward, all papers that have passed the initial review by the track director, will be single-blindly reviewed by two reviewers before the presentations. The authors are given a chance to submit the revision no later than 7 days after the conference date. Once they pass the presentation, then the articles will be sent to the committee for content review before collected to be submitted to the publisher.
            </p>
            <h3>Initial Review</h3>
            <p>
                The track director evaluates each manuscript in the submission track to determine if its topic and content is suitable for consideration for the conference before being reviewed. Manuscripts that do not meet minimum criteria are returned to the authors, by changing the status to rejected. This is in the best interest of the authors who could then decide to either correct the problems or to resubmit the manuscript to a more appropriate venue, avoiding delays from a lengthy review process that would nonetheless lead to another rejection.
            </p>
            <h3>Peer Review</h3>
            <p>
                Manuscripts that pass the initial review by the Track Directors, will be sent to referees based on their expertise. Each manuscript is reviewed by at least two referees. The referees are asked to evaluate the manuscript based on its originality, soundness of methodology, impact to design research, and relevance to design practices. To facilitate timely publication, referees are asked to complete their reviews and provide individual critiques within two weeks. After collecting the referees' reports, the Track Director makes a recommendation on the acceptability of the manuscript.
            </p>
            <h3>Acceptance Decision</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the referees' comments, the Track Director makes a final decision on the acceptability of the manuscript and communicates to the authors the decision, along with referees' reports. The status reports to reviewers should identify the reviewers of each paper, the final decision can be "Accept Submission", "Revisions Required", or "Decline Submission." The revised version should be submitted considering the review comments.
            </p>
            <h3>Plagiarism</h3>
            <p>
                The authors should make sure that the manuscript pass a criterion of less than 25 percents similarity to other publications. The publisher, however, has the right to reject the submission according to the policy of the publisher.
